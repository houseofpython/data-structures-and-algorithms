# Comparisons

Branch Name: hashmap-repeated-word

Challenge Type: Code Challenge / Algorithm

Feature Tasks
Write a function called repeated word that finds the first word to occur more than once in a string
Arguments: string
Return: string

## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency

Big O(1) for time because the hashtable is computating 

Big O(size  plus n) for space because parameter and total keys


# Time

This took 1 and half hours
