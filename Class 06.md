# Challenge Title

Linked-list-insertion 

Write the following methods for the Linked List class:

append
arguments: new value
adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
insert before
arguments: value, new value
adds a new node with the given new value immediately before the first node that has the value specified
insert after
arguments: value, new value
adds a new node with the given new value immediately after the first node that has the value specified

## Approach & Efficiency

Big On time and space because we only check through each node once at worst case scenario, and we are only creating one instance in space for a new node with the value
