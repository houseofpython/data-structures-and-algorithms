# Stack-Queue

Stack
Create a Stack class that has a top property. It creates an empty Stack when instantiated.
This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to top when the stack is created.
The class should contain the following methods:
push
Arguments: value
adds a new node with that value to the top of the stack with an O(1) Time performance.
pop
Arguments: none
Returns: the value from node from the top of the stack
Removes the node from the top of the stack
Should raise exception when called on empty stack
peek
Arguments: none
Returns: Value of the node located at the top of the stack
Should raise exception when called on empty stack
is empty
Arguments: none
Returns: Boolean indicating whether or not the stack is empty.
Queue
Create a Queue class that has a front property. It creates an empty Queue when instantiated.
This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to front when the queue is created.
The class should contain the following methods:
enqueue
Arguments: value
adds a new node with that value to the back of the queue with an O(1) Time performance.
dequeue
Arguments: none
Returns: the value from node from the front of the queue
Removes the node from the front of the queue
Should raise exception when called on empty queue
peek
Arguments: none
Returns: Value of the node located at the front of the queue
Should raise exception when called on empty stack
is empty
Arguments: none
Returns: Boolean indicating whether or not the queue is empty

## Whiteboard Process
n/a no whiteboard needed

## Approach & Efficiency


Big O 1n for time
BIG O On for space


## Solution

[]()
        return False
