# Graph-breadth-first

Branch Name: graph-breadth-first

Challenge Type: Extending an Implementation

Feature Tasks
Write the following method for the Graph class:

breadth first
Arguments: Node
Return: A collection of nodes in the order they were visited.
Display the collection

## Whiteboard Process

## Approach & Efficiency

Big O(v) where  v is the nodes visited in the graphâ€™

Space is O(v) where we visit we will create a duplicate value to the list and set
