# Graph-depth-first

Challenge Type: Extending an Implementation

Feature Tasks
Write the following method for the Graph class:

Name: Depth first
Arguments: Node (Starting point of search)
Return: A collection of nodes in their pre-order depth-first traversal order
Program output: Display the collection

## Approach & Efficiency

Big O(v) where  v is the nodes visited in the graphâ€™

Space is O(v) where we visit we will create a duplicate value to the list and set
