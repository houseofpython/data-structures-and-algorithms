# Tree Intersection

Write a function called tree_intersection that takes two binary trees as parameters.
Using your Hashmap implementation as a part of your algorithm, return a set of values found in both trees.

## Approach & Efficiency

Big O(n) time and space for both because are traversing each node only once and adding the values only once to the set


# Time

This took 1 and half hours
